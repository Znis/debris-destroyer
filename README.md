# debris-destroyer
The Debris Destroyer game, designed for Windows platform, lets players pilot a spaceship to shoot space debris, earning points. While doing so, players must also manage the spaceship's health and fuel levels, refilling them at checkpoint satellites. This game not only entertains but also educates players about the critical global issue of space debris.

The game was crafted in Unity Engine with the C# programming language. Its assets, such as spaceships, satellites, planets, and the moon, were sourced from NASA's official resources.
